# CameraHub

CameraHub is a web app for film photography that can be used to track cameras, lenses, accessories, films, negatives and prints, to fully
catalogue a collection of photographic equipment as well as the pictures that are made with them.

It replaces an earlier command-line project, called [PhotoDB](https://github.com/djjudas21/photodb-perl), which has now been deprecated.

## Installing CameraHub

There are several ways of installing CameraHub, depending on your needs:

* With Pip
* [From source](docs/INSTALL_SOURCE.md)
* [With Docker](docs/INSTALL-DOCKER.md)
* [With Kubernetes](docs/INSTALL-KUBERNETES.md)

## Configuring CameraHub

CameraHub requires almost no additional config to run with default settings. However it is insecure in this configuration so at least `CAMERAHUB_SECRET_KEY` and
`CAMERAHUB_PROD` must be set if you are running in production.

The following environment variables are supported:

| Variable                   | Use                                                                                              | Default                                  |
