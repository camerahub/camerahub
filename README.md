# PhotoDB

PhotoDB is a web app for film photography that can be used to track cameras, lenses, accessories, films, negatives and prints, to fully
catalogue a collection of photographic equipment as well as the pictures that are made with them. Read the [Concepts](docs/CONCEPTS.md)
section for full details on the capabilities of PhotoDB.

It replaces an earlier command-line project, also called [PhotoDB](https://github.com/djjudas21/photodb-perl), which has now been deprecated.
