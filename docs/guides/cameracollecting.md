# Camera collecting workflow

These instructions are written for cameras and camera models, but are
identical for lenses and lens models too.

## Terminology

Camera Model: any model of camera that has been marketed Camera: a
specific example of a Camera Model in your collection

## Search for existing camera model

Use the search box in the top right corner (in folding menu on small
screens) or browse the Camera Model list, using filters if you wish.

## Add a new camera model if necessary

You'll need to add a new Camera Model to CameraHub if it doesn't
already exist. Please enter accurate data - it is better to leave
something blank rather than guess or make something up.

## Add a camera

Click "add one to my collection" and supply extra details like the
cost

## Sell a camera

Browse to the Camera detail and click "sell". Selling also includes
donating or discarding.
