            <h5 class="mb-1">What kind of cameras can I catalogue with CameraHub?</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">Any kind of still image film camera can be catalogued. CameraHub is not suitable for digital
            cameras or motion picture (movie) cameras.</p>

            <h5 class="mb-1">Can I catalogue digital-era lenses?</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">You can add a lens to CameraHub if it works with film cameras, even if it was intended for
            digital cameras. For example, recent Canon EF lenses which were sold with full-frame digital SLRs in mind,
            but which still work with 35mm SLRs.</p>

            <h5 class="mb-1">What about language support?</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">CameraHub is in UK English. It is not currently on the roadmap to translate the site into other
            languages.</p>
        <p class="mb-1">Regarding the data inside CameraHub, it is always preferred to use Latin characters. For example
            we prefer <em>Zorki</em> instead of <em>Зоркий</em>.</p>
        <p>If a camera has different names in different regions, The UK or European name is preferred. For example, the
            <em>Canon EOS 500</em> was marketed as the <em>Canon EOS 500</em> in Europe, Asia and Oceania, as the
            <em>Canon EOS Kiss</em> in Japan and the <em>Canon EOS Rebel XS</em> in America. There is a feature on the
            roadmap to support multiple names for cameras.</p>
