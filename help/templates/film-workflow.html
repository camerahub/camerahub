This guide explains a suggested workflow for shooting film.

<h4>Buying film</h4>

As soon as you buy a film, add it to <a href="{% url 'schema:film-list' %}">Films</a> with information about its type,
expiry, cost, etc. It will then be allocated a number and marked as Available for loading into cameras etc.

<h4>Loading film</h4>

Mark the film as loaded when you load it into the camera. You can also enter a title etc.

<h4>Shooting film</h4>

Record each exposure you make as a <a href="{% url 'schema:negative-list' %}">Negative</a> in CameraHub, associated with
the film.

Each negative will be allocated a unique identifier like <code>#1.5</code> which consists of the number of the film that
the negative belongs to, and the frame number within that film.

<h4>Processing film</h4>

<h4>Archiving film</h4>

<h4>Printing negatives</h4>

<h4>Scanning negatives &amp; prints</h4>
